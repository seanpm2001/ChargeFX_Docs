# ChargeFX Docs

## No limits?

ChargeFX is an event driven sound effect tool. It does not have any limitations built in on the number of sound effects and events you can place. The only limits are:

- How much storage space you can expend
- How much time can you expend
- How long before it drives you completely crazy/overloads your computer/virtual machine

Ideally, it is recommended to have between 1 and 10 events defined for normal use. It might start to get annoying if you have it play a sound effect every time you drop 0.01% battery. For normal use, just define events in moderation.
